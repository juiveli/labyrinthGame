## How to improve this project

Before making pull request, there are few things to do.

- We do not want to have merge commits, so you should rebase to main branch before making a pull request. If there is a push after your pull request from another source, we figure it out, which might mean merge commit, but hopefully not

- We use mega linter v6. More info how to use it locally can be found on <https://npm.io/package/mega-linter-runner>

- Your pull request need to pass all tests defined with github actions
